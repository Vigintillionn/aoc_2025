# My AOC 2025 solutions in Haskell

## Workflow

1. To start a day run `./new-day.sh XX` a Haskell template is generated
2. Put your data into `inputs/dayXX.txt`
3. Implement your part-1 and part-2 solutions in `src/DayXX.hs`
4. Run the solution using `ghci` as follows:

```hs
ghci src/DayXX.hs
# inside ghci:
> main
```
